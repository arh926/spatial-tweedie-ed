# spatial-tweedie-ed
Repository (R-scripts) for implementation of algorithms that perform spatial modeling for the Tweedie exponential dispersion family. This includes synthetic data, real data, and relevant functions compiled into a package for future reference. "Spatial Tweedie exponential dispersion models: an application to insurance rate-making."
